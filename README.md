# Angular GPT Interface

A quick and dirty chatGPT style interface built to integrate into an API I built using my new library found here: 

[Laravel Open AI Conversations](https://github.com/l4nos/laravel-open-ai-conversations)

## Uses:

- Tailwind
- Highlight.js
- Angular Clipboard

&nbsp;
> ### Disclaimer
> This isn't finished or polished, plenty of stuff to do to it such as responsive and proper loading states. I built this for my own personal use, but you are welcome to use it as a convenient starting point to any project.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
